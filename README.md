**State of the Art for MNIST Data Classification** MNIST is a popular benchmark dataset for handwritten digit recognition. Over the years, various machine learning and deep learning techniques have been applied to achieve state-of-the-art performance on this dataset. In this project, we will explore the performance of two neural network models, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), for classifying the MNIST digits.

**Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** ANN is a type of feedforward neural network, commonly used for pattern recognition and classification tasks. In the context of MNIST classification, an ANN can be designed with one or more hidden layers, each comprising multiple neurons. These hidden layers learn non-linear representations of the input data, enabling the network to capture complex patterns and make accurate predictions.

We will implement an ANN using the PyTorch framework. The ANN model will consist of fully connected layers, where each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous and subsequent layers. By training the ANN on the MNIST dataset, we aim to achieve a high accuracy level in recognizing handwritten digits.

**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** CNNs have revolutionized image classification tasks, including MNIST digit recognition. Unlike ANNs, CNNs leverage the concept of local receptive fields, shared weights, and spatial hierarchies to efficiently extract features from images. These features are learned by applying convolutional and pooling layers, which enable the network to detect edges, shapes, and other relevant patterns in the input images.

We will also implement a CNN using PyTorch for the MNIST classification task. The CNN model will consist of convolutional layers, followed by pooling layers, and fully connected layers at the end. This architecture allows the CNN to automatically learn and capture intricate spatial features present in the MNIST images, leading to improved accuracy in digit classification.

By comparing the accuracy of both the ANN and CNN models on the MNIST dataset, we can gain insights into the performance differences between these two neural network architectures. This analysis will provide valuable information on which model performs better for handwritten digit recognition, thereby contributing to the understanding of deep learning techniques in image classification tasks.

**Conclusion:**
In the comparison of accuracy between an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification on the MNIST dataset, the CNN outperformed the ANN with an accuracy of 98.74% compared to 90.56%. This significant difference in accuracy demonstrates the superiority of CNNs for image classification tasks.

**Reasons for Higher Performance of CNN:**

**Exploiting Local Spatial Patterns:** CNNs are designed to capture local spatial patterns in images through convolutional layers. This allows them to learn and detect features such as edges, textures, and corners, which are crucial for image classification. In contrast, ANNs lack the spatial awareness that CNNs possess, making them less effective at capturing such patterns.

**Hierarchical Feature Extraction:** CNNs consist of multiple layers, including convolutional layers and pooling layers, which enable hierarchical feature extraction. Lower layers learn low-level features, while higher layers learn more complex and abstract features. This hierarchical representation allows CNNs to discriminate between different classes more effectively compared to ANNs.

**Parameter Efficiency:** CNNs are parameter-efficient due to weight sharing and the use of convolutional filters. Weight sharing enables the network to reuse learned features across different parts of the image, reducing the number of parameters required. In contrast, ANNs have a fully connected architecture, resulting in a larger number of parameters, making them more prone to overfitting and requiring more training data.

**Translation Invariance:** CNNs utilize pooling layers, which downsample the feature maps, making them less sensitive to small translations or shifts in the input image. This translation invariance property allows CNNs to recognize patterns or objects in different locations within the image, improving their generalization ability. ANNs lack this property, which can limit their performance on image classification tasks.

In summary, the higher performance of CNNs compared to ANNs in image classification tasks, as demonstrated by the accuracy comparison on the MNIST dataset, can be attributed to their ability to exploit local spatial patterns, hierarchical feature extraction, parameter efficiency, and translation invariance. These characteristics make CNNs more suitable and effective for capturing and learning image-specific features, resulting in superior performance in image classification tasks.
